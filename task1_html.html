<b><h2>About HTML</h2></b>
<p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It uses tags to structure and format the content on a web page. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs and &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; for headings. These tags define the structure and hierarchy of the content.</p>

<b><h2>Formatting Tags</h2></b>		
<p>HTML provides various formatting tags to style and format text. For example, you can use the &lt;b&gt; lag to make text bold, the <is tag to make it italic, and the &lt;u&gt; tag to underline it. There are also tags for superscript (<sup>), subscript («sub>), and strikethrough (<>). You can combine these tags to achieve different formatting effects.
This text is bold. This text is Italic. This text is underlined. This text is normal. Superseript subscript Strikethreugh</p>

<b><h2>span Tags</h2></b>
<p>The «span> tag is used to group inline elements and apply styles to specific parts of the text. You can assign a class or an ID to a «span> element and then use CSS to style it accordingly. This can be useful when you want to highlight specific words or phrases within a paragraph. HIML is <mark>easy</mark> to lear and <mark>fun</mark> to use.
